# Shapekit

Shapekit is the pysics engine for lame. Because of a combination of thread safety and me being lazy reasons, lame, and by extension Shapekit do not mutate entities/shapes, but run functions to produce a modified version.

On this github and on my machine I have toyed with many iterations of Shapekit and this is both the simplest and best.
